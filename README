                           SATK - Stand-alone Tool Kit

Copyright (C) 2012-2015 Harold Grovesteen                     

SATK is intended to assist in the development of stand-alone, or baremetal,
programs on mainframe compatible systems.  While targeting the Hercules emulator,
nothing precludes its use with "big-iron" real or virtual environments.

The following directories are provided:
    asma            - A Small Mainframe Assembler (ASMA) for stand-alone
                      programs.  ASMA runs wherever Python 3.3 runs!
    doc             - Various related documentation.
    doc/asma        - ASMA related documentation
    doc/iplelf      - Documentation related to the IPL ELF Supplement and SATK 
                      support.
    lib             - GNU ld linker scripts
    samples         - Various IPL related samples
    samples/asma    - Sample programs using ASMA
    src             - source code for use in stand-alone programs.
    src/drivers     - Device drivers - very experimental, do not recommend use
    src/hal         - Hardware Abstraction Layer
    src/ipl         - IPL ELF supporting source
    src/ipl/include - Routines useful for IPL ELF stage0 loaders.
    src/storage     - Storage management functions.  Only static assignment 
                      supported.
    srcasm          - Bare-metal facilities using ASMA.
    tools           - Python and bash tools for use with SATK.
                         asma.py - command-line interface to ASMA
                         codepage.py - ASMA code page customization
                         msl.py - Machine Specification Language (MSL) processor
                         mslrpt.py - MSL architecture comparison report
                         xmi.py - XMI file format PDS and member utility
    tools/ipl       - IPL ELF Media Preparation Processor, iplmed.py, and 
                      related tools: ipldpp.py, media.py
    xforth          - Forth language cross-compiler framework
